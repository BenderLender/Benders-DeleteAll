# Benders-DeleteAll

This is something I have re-made a while back and decided to publish it again.

# Configurations
- Set Permission to restrict the command.
- change the command name.
- set the time between each delete cycle.
- can change the chat message in sv.lua

# What does this script do?
The script run automatically at a set time delay. When the time ends all the unattended vehicles get deleted off the map.
The script does not delete peds or vehicles in use.
